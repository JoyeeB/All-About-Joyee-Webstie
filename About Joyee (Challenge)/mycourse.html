		<h1> Cybersecurity and Forensics </h1>
		<h2> Overview </h2>
			<p> BEng (Hons) Cybersecurity and Forensics has been awarded full undergraduate certification from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – the first undergraduate course in the UK to achieve full accreditation.
Combining three of the most sought-after streams of computing, this course capitalises on the rising awareness of the importance of network security and is a valuable foundation to a successful and well-paid career.

Two years of general computing studies will lead you to the specialty areas of security and forensics, software development and computer networks. After four years, you’ll have the expertise needed to create and analyse effective and secure computer systems.

In the computing career market, the demand for security engineers is increasing. As a graduate, you’ll have the wide range of skills plus the specialised expertise in data security needed to move into a variety of roles. </p>
		
		<h2> Course Details </h2>
			<p> This course will provide you with the knowledge and skills required to pursue a career in a computing-related field, which will allow the application of security and digital forensics expertise.

You will be taught the principles of security and digital forensics, using specialist software and equipment.

During your studies you will gain the ability to apply professional standards to the analysis, design, testing, evaluation and modification of reliable and maintainable software.

In addition, you will be able to develop critical, analytical and problem solving skills in relation to computing issues </p>
						
		<h2> Year by Year </h2>
			<p> This particular course is four years including a Work Placement Year in the third year. </p>
			<h3> Entry Requirements </h3>
			<p> Our entry requirements indicate both Standard and Minimum qualifications with which we normally accept students. Competition for places varies from year to year and you aren't guaranteed a place if you meet the minimum qualifications. </p>
			
			<h3> Work Placement </h3>
				<p> The Overseas Studies module SOC09104 provides an exciting opportunity for students to spend a semester studying abroad at a sister University. It is aimed at students who are not undertaking the year of Work Based Learning and usually replaces the second semester of Stage 3 – however, arrangements can be made for the module to be undertaken at other times. Students who have completed this module have been exceptionally enthusiastic about the learning opportunities it offers. A study plan is drawn up in advance and approved by a small panel of academic staff of the School of Computing. We currently have established links with universities in Germany, Finland and Sweden where relevant programmes are delivered in English. </p>
