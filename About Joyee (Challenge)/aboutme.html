		<h1> About Me </h1>
		<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p> In my journey in the computing field, I have acquired a wide range of technical knowledge and skills, from pre-GCSEs to my current University course (Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics BEng). I have also gained practical and business skills from previous work experience and personal projects, which have exposed me to various programming languages, operating systems, development tools and environments. I am eager to develop and refine my software skills and expand my range within the industry.
 </p>
		
		<h2> My Skills </h2>
			<p> I am a highly motivated and organised individual with excellent communication and organisational skills. I have a strong work ethic and am comfortable working in team environments. In my previous job as a Café Assistant, I successfully addressed conflicts and concerns among my colleagues and presented solutions to management. Additionally, my practical skills involve multilingualism and proficiency in various software programs. I have experience working with customers and can effectively build relationships with regular clients. I have high-quality interpersonal skills gained from my hobbies, like performing arts and volunteering. I have programming experience in Python, Java, C++, and SQL as well as with most operating systems.
 </p>
						
		<h2> My Personal Statement </h2>
			<p> Technology and social media are central to modern life, bringing positive and negative impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of technology and social media. People's mental health has been negatively impacted, which is often ignored by large companies and the public. This potentially threatens society and is the reason I’m so invested in this subject. Even though the internet is a recent contribution to our lives with many positives, there’s much to learn by challenging the negative impacts. I feel this subject can help with such problems and bring a much-needed change. I watched a documentary, “The Social Dilemma”, highlighting the uncontrollably evolving misinformation and corruption in social media, showing a machine that manipulates and subverts. As I learn more about this, I devotedly want to be involved and do something to contribute.
 </p>
			<p> The recent lockdowns demonstrate that self-motivation when working in isolation is key. During this time, I took extra courses on Recommender Systems (which I studied for my NEA project). The documentary I referred to is about the corruption of such systems. I found the more I learned, the more I saw the need to change our future direction. My GCSE and A-level Computer Science studies equipped me to solve problems with logical and analytical thinking, which is critical in this field. Furthermore, this course requires an ability to organise and classify large amounts of data and to anticipate and diagnose problems; skills I acquire from taking A level Maths. Learning languages such as Spanish and speaking Bengali enables me to solve and investigate different problems as I can see things from different views and cultures. I developed confidence to work creatively through my Music GCSE studies, as well as attending a Performing Arts School. Moreover, performing exposed me to high-pressure situations, training me to be resilient when tackling hurdles, making mistakes and working constructively with others. I also contributed to school plays as a lighting crew member, where I used software and artistry to envision different scenes in the best possible ways. </p>
			<p> I’ve gained new skills from employment which will help me settle into university life. For example, I worked busy weekends at a restaurant. In the fast-paced environment, we worked as a tight-knit team for a smooth, efficient operation. I also volunteered in retail, where I was taught interpersonal and organisational skills. My current jobs at a local cafe and a card shop involve tasks like making coffee, restocking, serving, and cashing up. For both jobs, teamwork is crucial to keep a positive atmosphere among everyone throughout the day. During my work experience in the GIS Department of BANES Council, I used GIS software to carry out different tasks, including fieldwork, which involved taking measurements and converting them on paper, working very closely with accuracy, which I know is significant within this course. Overall, I received positive feedback from the client for accuracy.
 </p>
			<p> I participated in team-dependent groups, such as Girl Guides and DofE Bronze Award where cooperating with others is the only way to overcome hindrances. For example, I took part in the NCS Award Programme where, as a team, we implemented a project to benefit the community. This project involved many challenges such as feasibility and resource management. After many meetings and presentations, we successfully concluded our event, raising awareness and money for the charity Young Minds. These collaborations helped me develop patience and trust with different people, aiding me to work in teams to overcome obstacles, a vital skill in this study, especially for large projects and investigations. I believe that my skills are an ideal match for this course and I’d welcome the opportunity to become a successful student making positive contributions.
